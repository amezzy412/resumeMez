    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <h3>Qualcomm/Skyhook - Wayne PA <br> Product Manager / Jan 2022-Sep 2023</h3>
    <p>In this role, my responsibilities included managing and inventory of
        SaaS and front-end products used for precision locations services.
        Examples of these products include an Android SDK, an API endpoint,
        an embedded client on device hardware, and an Android APK that
        could be deployed to Android devices. Each of these products
        consisted of different functionality and were deployed at different
        frequencies. The development team leveraged CI/CD; these
        deployments ranged from hours to weeks depending on the product.
        In my role I was able to engage with the full development team daily
        ensuring that requirements were aligned, and timelines were being
        addressed. This role included internal customer engagement as well
        as hands on testing of specific product functionality.</p>
    <h3>Aramark - Phildalephia,PA <br> Product Manager / Jan 2018-Dec 2021</h3>
    <p>I was responsible for three distinct products which served different
        purposes throughout the organization: <br> <br>
        <u>Frontline Associate Service iOS Application</u> <br>
        This product was a greenfield development effort taken on by Aramark
        developed specifically for the frontline associate. The team worked in
        the agile eXtreme programming manner which included, test driven
        development, pair programming, continuous integration and
        deployment, and user driven design and prioritization. My time was
        primarily spent on the latter, where I engaged in numerous
        conversations, deep interviews, and testing with our end user base to
        understand usage of the product and capabilities for future
        enhancements. I continually collaborated with our design team to synthesize the feedback. Once the input was synthesized, I created a
        managed the backlog of user stories for the development team to work
        from and deliver. This encompassed: creating the user stories, testing
        the capabilities, and finally accepting them as complete for release. <br><br>
        <u>Frontline Manager Platform</u><br>
        This product was developed with a third-party platform to unlock data
        silos for the frontline manager. The product featured near real-time
        overtime alerts, visibility into location revenue, and communication
        features that enables manager to increase productivity in their day to
        day. The frontend solution was powered through the AI and data
        platform. Features were prioritized based on user feedback, key
        stakeholder input, and data availability. The product was released to
        over 500 users at Aramark’s annual operating meeting. <br><br>
        <u>Budgeting Tool Web Application</u><br>
        The operational excellence department identified the business need for
        a budgeting tool for Aramark’s frontline managers. I closely
        coordinated efforts with offshore development team and key
        stakeholders to create a robust budgeting tool. This product required
        integration with disparate data sources while incorporating strict data
        standards for budgeting purposes.
        <h3>IT Technical Analyst / August 2014-Dec 2017</h3>
        Aramark gave me my first opportunity straight out of college and my
        responsibilities expanded over those first few years. I was enrolled in
        the Accelerate to Leadership (A2L) program which was a yearlong
        program that provided me with rotational opportunities throughout the
        organization. For my third rotation I landed in the Enterprise Analytics
        group where I really found a good niche. During my time on the team, I
        was able to gain a deep understanding of QlikSense and QlikView as
        well as introduction to other BI tools. I was involved in every aspect of
        the end user application creation and in some cases I developed the
        end user application personally. My role eventually grew into
        managing different efforts for our internal customers primarily HR and
        finance. I lead the development effort on deploying key operational
        metrics at every level of the organization. I also had an integral role in
        the deployment of Aramark’s engagement survey results, providing
        integral testing and analysis of results. Before I moved into the product
        management role, I was able to build a BI application to analyze the
        user trends on the application I eventually came to manage.
